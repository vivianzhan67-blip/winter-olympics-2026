<p>
The Olympics are held every 2 years alternating between Summer and Winter events. This year is the Winter Olympics turn and they are being held in Italy. They run through most of the month of February, beginning February 4 (although the opening ceremony is 2 days later on February 6) and concluding on February 22. The Olympics are the largest international, multi-sport events in the world!

<p>
    Skiers, snowboarders, skaters, bobsledders, and many other winter sport athletes are getting ready to compete in these Olympic games. They will strive to break records, defeat opponents, and win medals not only for their own accolades but also for their home countries. This year, for the first time in 12 years, NHL hockey players are given a break in their regular schedule to participate in the <a href="sports.html#hockey">Olympics hockey</a>.

The 2026 Winter Olympics are being hosted in Italy, primarily in the regions of Cortina d'Ampezzo and Milan. The last time Italy hosted the Olympics was 20 years ago in 2006. For this year's Olympics, Sweden was a contender hoping to host the games, but they lost the bid to Italy when it was voted on in 2019.
